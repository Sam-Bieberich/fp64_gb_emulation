# Emulation

The primary purpose of this repository is to hold the workflow and data from my emulation experiments on the Vista GB200 node system and the GB10 Spark. 

First, I used the Ozaki Scheme II repository to emulate the fp64 operations with INT8 dgemm. The results and some of the necessary instructions to run these tests on the hardware I used are in the ozimmu_data_analysis subdirectory, and the CMAKE_INSTRUCTIONS.md file.
